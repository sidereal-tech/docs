          YT trades route through the same PT/SY pool in one atomic step. There is no separate YT
          pool, so YT and PT prices can never disagree with each other. The mechanism is in{" "}

        <h2>Reading the numbers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Implied APY (TWAP)</strong>: the fixed rate the market is offering, averaged
            over the last 30 minutes. Averaging smooths out any single trade&rsquo;s footprint, so
            this is the trustworthy reference number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spot APY</strong>: the same rate at this exact instant. Your trade executes
            against spot, and your own trade moves it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maturity</strong>: days remaining. The same price discount over less time
            means a higher yearly rate, so prices get touchier as the clock runs down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reserves (SY)</strong>: how much is in the pool. Compare your trade size to
            it. The quote already includes the price impact of your own trade, and in a small pool
            that impact dominates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Slippage protection</h2>
        <p>
          Slippage is the gap between the price you were quoted and the price you actually get,
          caused by the market moving in between. Every Sidereal swap carries a floor: the minimum
          you are willing to receive, derived from your quote and a tolerance setting. If the pool
          moves beyond the tolerance before your transaction lands, the transaction cancels itself
          instead of filling at the worse price. A cancelled transaction still costs its (tiny)
          network fee, so in fast-moving conditions, ask for a fresh quote rather than widening
          the tolerance.
        </p>

      <div className="mt-8">
        <Callout label="Current pool depth" signal>
          The mainnet market is newly seeded and shallow. Small trades work fine; size will move
          the rate sharply against you, and the quote will show it. Splitting and holding (see{" "}
          <Link href="/guides/mint">Deposit and split</Link>) works at any size, no pool
          required.

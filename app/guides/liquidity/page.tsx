        <h2>What providing liquidity means</h2>
        <p>
          The trading pool needs inventory of both PT and SY to quote prices. Anyone can deposit
          that inventory. In exchange you receive <strong>LP tokens</strong>, a receipt for your
          share of the pool, and every trade that flows through pays a small fee that accrues to
          the pool you now co-own.
        </p>

        <h2>Adding liquidity</h2>
        <p>
          Deposits go in at the pool&rsquo;s current ratio of PT to SY. On the Pool page, enter
          either side (<strong>PT amount</strong> or <strong>SY amount</strong>) and the form
          computes the other. The <strong>Limiting side</strong> label tells you which of your two
          balances runs out first. The preview shows <strong>LP minted</strong>, your{" "}
          <strong>New share</strong> of the pool, and what stays in your wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need PT to pair with your SY? Split some SY first (see{" "}
          <Link href="/guides/mint">Deposit and split</Link>). One split produces the PT leg
          and leaves SY for the other side.
        </p>

        <h2>What LPs earn</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Trading fees</strong> on every embedded PT leg in the book. A YT buy-and-sell
            round trip pays the fee twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curve convergence.</strong> V1 moves its PT-per-SY-share factor toward one as
            maturity approaches. Because v1 omits the SY-share-to-asset normalization, this is not
            a guarantee that impermanent loss reaches zero when an SY share is worth more than one
            underlying unit. The factory-built AMM corrects that unit boundary.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Removing liquidity</h2>
        <p>
          Enter an <strong>LP amount</strong> (your <strong>LP balance</strong> is shown) and the
          preview quotes <strong>PT received</strong>, <strong>SY received</strong>, and the{" "}
          <strong>Pool share burned</strong>. Withdrawals carry the same protection as swaps: a
          minimum-you-will-accept floor. If trading moves the pool past your tolerance between
          quote and submission, the whole withdrawal cancels itself. There are no partial fills.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cancelled withdrawal still costs its small network fee. If the pool is busy, ask for a
          fresh quote instead of resubmitting a stale one.
        </p>

        <h2>Holding LP across maturity</h2>
        <p>
          At maturity the pool&rsquo;s PT equals SY by definition, so withdrawing at that point is
          clean. Nothing forces you out at the boundary; LP positions can be withdrawn during the
          wind-down after maturity too. LP balances live in rent-paying persistent storage, which
          the app keeps topped up, and even a lapsed entry is archived rather than deleted and can
          be restored (see <Link href="/settlement">Settlement and maturity</Link>).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mt-8">
        <Callout label="Early-market economics" signal>
          In a shallow pool, fees scale with trading volume, and volume is small today. Early LP
          returns come mostly from PT&rsquo;s glide, not fees. The flip side: early liquidity is
          what makes the market usable at all, and your share of the pool is largest while the
          pool is small.
